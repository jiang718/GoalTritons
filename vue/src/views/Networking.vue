   <div class="two">
     <p> Learn from others:</p>
     <li>Browse other people's profile pages for inspiration, such as those who have worked in your favorite company and held similar employment as you.</li>
     <li> Use the LinkedIn Alumni tool to check out the data of your alumni—where they work and live, especially people who are in the same industry as you.</li>
     <p>Be yourself:</p>
     <li>Avoid words like “specialized”, “passionate”, and “experienced” since they're overused on LinkedIn. Think about how you stand out and use words that characterize you.</li>
